           <h2>Poverty and the Uninsured:</h2>
           <p>Adults in low-income households are certianly more likely to be uninsured than people in higher income households, but not all unisured adults are in families with low income. Texas has the highest number of uninsured adults, 
             but does not have the highest number of families in poverty. Therefore, there must be other factors that contribute to whether an individual is insured, or not insured.</p>

          <h2>Poverty and Smoking:</h2>
           <p>In the U.S., people living below the poverty level have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general population. However, poverty does not appear to be  the only factor that contributes to the likelihood of cigarette smoking. States
            like California and New York fall around the median in terms of poverty rates, but have some of the lowest rates of smoking relative to their populations. </p>

            <h2>Poverty and Obesity:</h2>
            <p> The U.S. is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and accordingly has high obesity rates; one-third of the population has obesity plus another is overweight. It has been suggested that individuals
               who live in impoverished regins have poor access to fresh food. Povety-dense areas are often times called "food deserts," implying diminished access to fresh food. Again, there are states, such as New Hampshire, that very low poverty rates but still
               have relatively higher rates of obesity.</p>

               <h2>Age and the Uninsured:</h2>
               <p>Compared with other age groups, young adults are the most likely to go without coverage. This can be expected since young adults tend to be much healthier than other age groups, and can typically risk being uninsured. Massachusetts appears to have the lowest 
               number of uninsured individuals, while Texas has the highest rate, but a much lower median age. An interesting case is Florida, where the median age is much higher than other states at 42, but has a much higher rates of poverty.  </p>

              <h2>Age and Smoking:</h2>
              <p>It does appear that states with a large proportion of older age groups tend to have the highest rates of smoking. Prehaps states where
              the median age is higher have individuals that have smoked for many years, and have chosen not to quit. As opposed to states like Utah 
              where the median age is very low, and much of the population doesn't smoke at all.</p>

               <h2>Age and Obesity:</h2>
               <p>There does appear to be a small correlation between a states median age and level of obsity. It seems that higher age groups are more succeptible to being obese, but that is likely not always the case.
                  Older age groups are typically less active than younger groups, and would do a lot to explain why an older person is more likely to be obese. Clearly there are other factors, like poverty and income that will directly obesity levels.</p>

                   <p>Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage for their health. Most uninsured people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family. 
                    Reflecting the more than limited availablity of public coverage in some states. This is very clearly the case in Texas where the level of uninsured individuals is the highest in the country.</p>

                  <h2>Income and Smoking</h2>
                  <p>A household's income contributes directly to the level of poverty. States with the highest rates of poverty tend to have the greater population of individuals that smoke, and states with lower median household income will tend to
                   also have higher rates of smoking. States with relatively higher median incomes have some of the lowest rates of smoking.

                  <p>Overall obesity prevalence does tend to decrease with increased levels of income. Just as poverty affects the availablity of healthy food options, ad does income. Lower residents likely do not have the same access to low cost healthy 
                    food choices as does higher income groups.
